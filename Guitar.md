# Things to keep in mind playing for a new song
## Clap the pulse, feel the rythm and get the timing
## Measure each chord length
## 1/8 or 1/16th feel -- get the strumming pattern
## observe where to come in 4th beat or 2.5th or 3.5th , pickup 
## strum couple of measures to get to the pickup 
## sing in head and strum last line of the chorus to get to the song
## realise each measure continually

# Problems faced
## extra beats 
## click and strum off 
## word not on beat

# How to practice to get the rythm
## Slowly each line at a time
## thrice to get it right
## click and strum at the same time, no delays
